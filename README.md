The following is a link to my personal website using Github Pages:
~~http://redbairn.github.io/profile~~ 

[craigbell.ie] (http://craigbell.ie/)

- The website is built using HTML, CSS, jQuery Mobile and JavaScript.
- I would have broken up the page, however, I could not use a server-side language (like PHP) to make it more modular because Github Pages does not allow for this.
- The website has the following sections:-
  - About
  - Education
  - Experience
  - Skillset
  - Projects
  - Social
- A contact form is created in the menu but because we can't use a server-side language here I've decide to use [Formspree] (https://formspree.io/)
- The portfolio website links back to projects which are stored as repositories here on Github.

**Currently a work in progress. :)**

**If there is anything that you see buggy on my website please feel free to contact me through the contact form**
